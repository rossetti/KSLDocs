This book is intended as an introductory textbook for a first course in discrete-event simulation modeling and analysis for upper-level undergraduate students as well as graduate students.  While the text is focused towards engineering students (primarily industrial engineering) it could also be utilized by computer science and data science majors.  Practitioners interested in learning simulation and the KSL could also use this book independently of a course.
